Overview
This project implements a book recommendation system using a dataset from Goodreads. The system processes book data, including genres, authors, and ratings, to generate recommendations based on user preferences. The notebook demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and clustering techniques to build the recommendation model.

Features
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and converts data types for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Uses OneHotEncoder for authors and MultiLabelBinarizer for genres to create a feature matrix.

Dimensionality Reduction: Applies PCA to reduce the feature space for efficient clustering.

Clustering: Uses KMeans clustering to group similar books for recommendations.

Scalability: Processes a dataset of 10,000 books with diverse attributes.

Dataset
The dataset (goodreads_data.csv) includes:

Book titles and authors

Descriptions and genres

Average ratings and number of ratings

URLs for further reference

Dependencies
Python 3

Pandas

Scikit-learn

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)

Usage
Data Preparation: Load and clean the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.

Dimensionality Reduction: Apply PCA to reduce features.

Clustering: Use KMeans to cluster books.

Recommendation: Generate recommendations based on cluster similarities.

Results
The system successfully clusters books into meaningful groups, enabling personalized recommendations. The elbow method helps determine the optimal number of clusters for the KMeans algorithm.


Future Improvements
Incorporate user ratings for personalized recommendations.

Enhance the model with collaborative filtering techniques.

Deploy the system as a web application for interactive use.
