Recommendation System Using Clustering
This project implements a recommendation system using a dataset sourced from Goodreads. It applies data preprocessing, feature encoding, dimensionality reduction, and clustering to group similar items and provide recommendations.

Overview
The system is built on a pipeline that includes:

Data cleaning and preparation

Feature engineering for categorical and numerical variables

Dimensionality reduction with PCA

Clustering using the KMeans algorithm

Recommendation generation based on cluster similarity

Features
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and ensures consistent formatting for analysis.

Feature Engineering:

One-hot encodes categorical features such as authors.

Uses multilabel binarization for fields like genres.

Dimensionality Reduction: Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify the feature space.

Clustering:

Implements KMeans for grouping similar entries.

Uses the elbow method to select the optimal number of clusters.

Scalable Design: Capable of processing a dataset with 10,000+ entries.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following attributes:

Titles and authors

Descriptions and genres

Average ratings and rating counts

Reference URLs

Dependencies
Python 3

pandas

scikit-learn

numpy

matplotlib (optional, for analysis and visualization)

Usage
Load and clean the dataset

Encode categorical and multi-categorical features

Normalize and reduce dimensions using PCA

Apply KMeans clustering

Generate recommendations based on cluster membership

Results
The system successfully clusters similar items, enabling meaningful and relevant recommendations. The elbow method effectively determines the optimal number of clusters for best performance.

Future Improvements
Integrate user rating history for personalized suggestions

Enhance with collaborative filtering techniques

Deploy as an interactive web application
